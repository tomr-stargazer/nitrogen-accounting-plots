Ok - so this is a flexible repository of code that will probably be related to exploration, analysis, and plotting for my N accounting paper.

I had some cruft sitting in there previously (writing now in October):
first_attempt*.py
test.pdf

Now I'm working on something a little more dedicated:
omc2_fir4_accounting.py
(uses only the Shimajiri numbers for the abundances)
